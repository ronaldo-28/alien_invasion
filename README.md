<h1 align="center">Welcome to üëΩ Alien Invasion Game üëã</h1>

> Alien Invasion is simple game which is built on python 3.10 using Pygame. In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. The player‚Äôs goal is to destroy a fleet of aliens that moves across and down the screen. The game becomes more challenging as the player progresses to new levels with faster aliens. The game ends when the player loses three ships or an alien reaches the bottom of the screen. The player can also press P to start the game and see their high score, which is saved in a file. The game features sound effects for firing bullets and hitting aliens. The game also has an AI mode that lets the computer control the ship and fire bullets automatically. The AI mode can change strategies mid-level and target specific aliens with improved accuracy.
